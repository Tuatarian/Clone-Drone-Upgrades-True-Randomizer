# Clone-Drone-Upgrades-True-Randomizer
In In Clone Drone in the Danger Zone, the random upgrades challenge heavily favors selecting a clone if you do not already have one. This is a simple project which provides much more random upgrade selection. The use of this repo is a bit unintuitive. It will choose one of the last upgrades on each path - you the player must select the upgrade which gets you closer to that upgrade. For example, if the program told me to get "Get Up" before I had "Kick", I would buy the Kick upgrade. It was done this way both because its easier to implement and requires less work from you the player (you do not have to input your current upgrades)
